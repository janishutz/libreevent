                <h1>Plugin installation</h1>
<p><strong>Installing plugins currently isn't easy. We expect you to know how to upload files to a server. If you don't know, a guide on how to upload things can be found in the setup guide which is meant for beginners</strong></p>
<h2>Acquiring the plugins</h2>
<p>You can find a list of plugins that libreevent supports <a href="/plugins">here</a>. Choose one and click it to be directed to the download page.</p>
<h2>Installing payment gateway plugins</h2>
<p>You can install a new plugin by navigating to the libreevent directory on the server and then by navigating to <em>/backend/plugins/payments</em> and uploading the plugin folder into there. Now, restart libreevent.</p>
<h2>Installing other plugins</h2>
<p>You can install a new plugin by navigating to the libreevent directory on the server and then by navigating to <em>/backend/plugins/others</em> and uploading the plugin folder into there. Now, restart libreevent.</p>
