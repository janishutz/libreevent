                <h1>Events</h1>
<p>This is the most feature rich admin page of libreevent. Here you can change everything regarding an event.</p>
<h2>Creating new events</h2>
<p>Creating new events is as simple as clicking the plus icon in the top right corner and following the prompts.</p>
<h3>Event name</h3>
<p>This is the name that is being displayed when users are browsing your events. Cannot be longer than 50 characters.</p>
<h3>Event description</h3>
<p>Describe what your event is about. It will be displayed underneath the event name when users are browsing your events. In the browsing view, the length of the description is limited to 150 characters, after which three dots will be added to the text and a 'continue reading' button will be added. Technically, there's no limit to the length of the event description, but don't overdo it with the length, as the user is unlikely to read more than a couple words anyway.</p>
<h3>Event location</h3>
<p>Choose a location where your event is going to take place. You can do so by selecting an existing location from the dropdown or by adding a new one. In the same step, you'll also need to choose between a seat plan and no seat plan, and if you choose a seat plan, you'll need to create one using out handy seatplan editor. See our seatplan editor guide <a href="/docs/admin-panel/seatplan-editor">here</a></p>
