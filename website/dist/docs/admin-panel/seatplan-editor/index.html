                <h1>Seatplan editor</h1>
<p>The seatplan editor is a graphical editor where you can create and modify the seating plan of virtually any room. We recommend that you start in the top left corner of the seatplan and then move down diagonally, as it is the easiest to do. Each so-called component can be either a stand area, a stage area or a seating area, with each of them featuring different layouts. You can change everything in the properties pane.</p>
<h2>Adding more components</h2>
<p>You may add more components by simply clicking the plus icon in the toolbar of the editor. The component will spawn in the top left corner of the seatplan and the view will automatically be moved towards it.</p>
<h2>Removing components</h2>
<p>You may remove components by clicking the trash icon or by hitting 'delete' on your keyboard.</p>
<h2>Editing history</h2>
<p>The editor features undo and redo functions such that you can undo your mistakes and accidental undos can be reverted. Just hit the corresponding button in the toolbar.</p>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>The editor does auto-save a draft every minute. Pressing Ctrl + S or hitting the Save button in the toolbar will immediately save the seatplan as a draft. Click the deploy button to save the seatplan permanently, irreversibly overwriting any potentially existing old seatplan of that location, except you change the location name after the fact.</p>
