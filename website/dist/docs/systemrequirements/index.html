                <h1>Systemrequirements</h1>
<p>libreevent's system requirements are low, you only need a PC or Server that can run node.js and is able to install npm packages. If the system you are trying to use is unable to download npm packages, you may download the packages on your own system and upload them together with the rest of the server files. How to do that is described in greater detail in the <a href="/docs/gettingStarted">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>
<h2>node.js</h2>
<p>Your system needs to be able to run node.js V &gt; 12.0 and must have access to either npm or the downloaded npm packages.</p>
<h2>Hardware requirements</h2>
<p>Hardware requirements solely depend on the amount of usage it is going to get. An average hosting plan should be able to handle about 1000 people. In case the system is not able to uphold the traffic, it will activate a protection to try and stop overloading and crashing the system. Although using multiple checks, we cannot guarantee that the system will never crash due to being overloaded, so, if the website is important, please overspec the server.</p>
