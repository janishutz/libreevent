                <h1>Payments</h1>
<p>Including many payment methods can help the user choose the one that fits them best, but can also be overwhelming and a pain to set up. So please try to use as few different payment gateways as possible. Officially, libreevent supports <em>Stripe</em> and <em>Payrexx</em>. More payment gateways might come in the future as a plugin which can be installed by following our guide <a href="/docs/plugins/install#payments">here</a></p>
<h2>Advantages / Disadvantages of each payment gateway</h2>
<h3>payrexx</h3>
<p>Payrexx is a Swiss, lesser known payment gateway and it is not ideal for you if you expect to have a low sales volume, as their basic plan costs you EUR 15 a month. If your sales volume is fairly high, it may be worth it as their per-transaction fees are quite a bit lower than Stripe's and they offer more payment options.
See payrexx <a href="https://www.payrexx.com/en/pricing/">pricing here</a> and sign up <a href="https://signup.payrexx.com">here</a>. You can find a full list of supported payment methods <a href="https://payrexx.com/en/paymentmethods">here</a></p>
<h3>Stripe</h3>
<p>Stripe is one of the most well known payment gateways out there and it is really easy to get started. See all their payment methods <a href="https://stripe.com/en-ch/payments/payment-methods">here</a>. If you choose to use Stripe, you may follow their guides on how to set up more payment options <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview">here</a>
See <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb/pricing">here</a> for pricing information and sign up <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">here</a></p>
