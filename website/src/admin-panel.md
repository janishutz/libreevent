The admin panel is where you can change basically everything about libreevent. 
<!-- In a future update, depending on your account's privileges, you may find more or less settings. Only the root account has access to the admin accounts page. Currently though, all pages are unlocked for all users. -->

Here's a list of the pages available when logged in as the root user. <!-- All other users have fewer pages enabled.-->
- [Events](&/admin-panel/events)
- [Locations](&/admin-panel/locations)
- [Pages](&/admin-panel/pages)
- [Plugins](&/admin-panel/plugins)
- [Seatplan editor](&/admin-panel/seatplan-editor)
- [Settings](&/admin-panel/settings)

<!-- Additionally, some settings might not be available to all admin accounts on all pages. -->

<!-- *As a general recommendation, we do not encourage logging in as the root user if not strictly necessary, as this can help protect the libreevent installation*. -->
