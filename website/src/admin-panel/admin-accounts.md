# Admin Accounts
On this page you may add, modify or remove admin accounts. Note that in order for you to see this page, you'll need to be logged in as the user root.

## Adding an account

### Privileges
libreevent features a privilege system where you can choose to what group of users you want to add a user you are currently creating. Possible values are:

Group           | Allowed settings
----------------|------------------
Root            | All pages. Can only be one account (the root account)
Admin           | Can access all pages and settings except for Admin Accounts
Event-Manager   | Access the events & pages page
Event-Handler   | Can log into the apps to do entry control


### Email
An Email address is required for account activation and to recover a password in case it gets lost. The system will automatically send an activation email so the user can confirm that the email address is valid. 


### 2FA
With this checkbox you can choose if this user needs to do two factor authentication, meaning, if the user needs to authorise the login using a link. In the [Settings](&/admin-panel/settings#2fa) you may choose between the two different 2FA modes that libreevent offers.
