# Events
This is the most feature rich admin page of libreevent. Here you can change everything regarding an event.

## Creating new events
Creating new events is as simple as clicking the plus icon in the top right corner and following the prompts.

### Event name
This is the name that is being displayed when users are browsing your events. Cannot be longer than 50 characters.

### Event description
Describe what your event is about. It will be displayed underneath the event name when users are browsing your events. In the browsing view, the length of the description is limited to 150 characters, after which three dots will be added to the text and a 'continue reading' button will be added. Technically, there's no limit to the length of the event description, but don't overdo it with the length, as the user is unlikely to read more than a couple words anyway.

### Event location
Choose a location where your event is going to take place. You can do so by selecting an existing location from the dropdown or by adding a new one. In the same step, you'll also need to choose between a seat plan and no seat plan, and if you choose a seat plan, you'll need to create one using out handy seatplan editor. See our seatplan editor guide [here](&/admin-panel/seatplan-editor)

## Guest purchase
Choose if a user may purchase a ticket without creating an account. An email address is always required as the system sends the tickets via email to the customers for easier access.

## Allow overbooking
Activate this and set a percentage of overbooking, if you want to enable overbooking of the event to ensure that every single spot is occupied even if somebody does not show up. Use is strongly discouraged and currently only works with events that have no seating plan.

## Special requirements
Here you may set a special requirement that a person booking a ticket has to fulfill, like the email address has to be ending in @yourdomain.com or they need to live in a certain street / town / city / country in order for them to be allowed to buy a ticket. You may also require that they provide a certain number, code or similar. Finally, you may choose to limit the amount of tickets a single person may reserve.
