# Payments
Including many payment methods can help the user choose the one that fits them best, but can also be overwhelming and a pain to set up. So please try to use as few different payment gateways as possible. Our recommendation is either *Stripe* or *adyen* as they are the most flexible. 

## Advantages / Disadvantages of each payment gateway

### payrexx
Payrexx is a lesser known payment gateway and it is not ideal for you if you expect to have a low sales volume, as their basic plan costs you EUR 15 a month. If your sales volume is fairly high, it may be worth is as their per-transaction fees are quite a bit lower than Stripe's and they offer more payment options.
See payrexx [pricing here](https://www.payrexx.com/en/pricing/) and sign up [here](https://signup.payrexx.com). You can find a full list of supported payment methods as they should be entered in the GUI [here](https://docs.payrexx.com/developer/general-info/payment-method)

### Stripe
Stripe is one of the most well known payment gateways out there and it is really easy to get started.
