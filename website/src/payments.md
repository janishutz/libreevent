# Payments
Including many payment methods can help the user choose the one that fits them best, but can also be overwhelming and a pain to set up. So please try to use as few different payment gateways as possible. Our recommendation is either *Stripe* or *adyen* as they are the most flexible. 

## Advantages / Disadvantages of each payment gateway

### Stripe
Stripe is one of the most well known payment gateways out there, but is also fairly expensive, but easy to set up.
See [here](https://stripe.com/en-gb/pricing) for pricing information and sign up [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)

### adyen
Adyen is used by small and huge businesses alike, but you have to email their support team for account creation, which is easy to do, but takes longer to complete. adyen is fairly cheap, "*only*" charging 0.10$ per transaction plus payment method costs. Detailed pricing information can be found [here](https://www.adyen.com/pricing) and you may sign up [here](https://www.adyen.com/contact/sales)
