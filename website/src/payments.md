# Payments
Including many payment methods can help the user choose the one that fits them best, but can also be overwhelming and a pain to set up. So please try to use as few different payment gateways as possible. Officially, libreevent supports *Stripe* and *Payrexx*. More payment gateways might come in the future as a plugin which can be installed by following our guide [here](&/plugins/install#payments)

## Advantages / Disadvantages of each payment gateway

### payrexx
Payrexx is a Swiss, lesser known payment gateway and it is not ideal for you if you expect to have a low sales volume, as their basic plan costs you EUR 15 a month. If your sales volume is fairly high, it may be worth it as their per-transaction fees are quite a bit lower than Stripe's and they offer more payment options.
See payrexx [pricing here](https://www.payrexx.com/en/pricing/) and sign up [here](https://signup.payrexx.com). You can find a full list of supported payment methods [here](https://payrexx.com/en/paymentmethods)

### Stripe
Stripe is one of the most well known payment gateways out there and it is really easy to get started. See all their payment methods [here](https://stripe.com/en-ch/payments/payment-methods). If you choose to use Stripe, you may follow their guides on how to set up more payment options [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview)
