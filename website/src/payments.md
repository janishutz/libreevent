# Payments
Including many payment methods can help the user choose the one that fits them best, but can also be overwhelming and a pain to set up. So please try to use as few different payment gateways as possible. Officially, libreevent supports *Stripe* and *Payrexx*. More payment gateways might come in the future as a plugin which can be installed by following our guide [here](&/plugins/install#payments)
