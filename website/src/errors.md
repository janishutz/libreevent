# Errors

## 404
A 404 error is returned if the page was not found on the server. This can be either due to a wrong link or a badly configured server, but is mostly user error, so a misspelled link.

## 500
An internal server error occurs when the server is unable to properly process a request, which in some cases might also return a [400](#400) error, if the server first decides that the request is unacceptable.
