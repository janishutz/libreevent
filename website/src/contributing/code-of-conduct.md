# Code of Conduct

If you would like to contribute code to libreevent, we'd like you to follow the following guidelines.
- Any code you want to contribute should have a reason to exist, please, if you find a bug or you have any idea for what you might want to contribute, ask around on GitHub, not that you do something nobody has use for or somebody else is already working on.
- Always be polite to other developers. They spend their free-time working on this project. Even if the code is not as good as you might want it to be, don't start to offend people, give them some constructive criticism or suggestions on how they can improve it.
- All the code that you produce should in no way be harmful to the consumer. If you have a proof-of-concept for a potential exploit, we'd like you to share it with us. 
- If you have code that is unfinished, and you don't have the time or willingness to finish it, please open a PR as a draft, and we'll mark it as up for grabs.
- Please do some testing on the code you write to make sure it works as expected. We will also do our own testing, but we expect you to have checked that everything is working as it should beforehand. 
- Please follow our programming style and make sure that eslint does not show any errors with the code you just wrote.
