# Design Guidelines

Everything in libreevent should be designed in a way that puts legibility and ease of use as its priority, instead of opting for special effects that are, undeniably, nice, but do not contribute to improved usability and, as every effect needs some lines of code, also wastes bandwidth that is very limited if a lot of people access the sites simultaneously.
