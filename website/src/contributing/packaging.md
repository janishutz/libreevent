# Packaging

To be able to work on libreevent, you need to have node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Then, to set up the development environment, run 
```
npm i
```

in the *src/server*, *src/webapp/main* and *src/webapp/setup* directories. This creates the *node_modules* folder in each of those directories. This is also what you need to do, if you want to upload the development version of libreevent.
