# Updating

Updating libre«ùvent is important to keep it secure, performant and bug-free. You can update libreevent automatically using the update tool on the settings page in the admin panel. The tool will automatically fetch all files that have been changed since the last version update. For this, it will have to make a webrequest to GitHub to fetch the JSON file with the update information. After that, many webrequests have to be performed to GitHub to download the new version. Before installing, the tool will show you the full changelog of the new version of libreevent. After the install has completed, you will need to restart libreevent such that the changes can be applied.
