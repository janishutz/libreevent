# Plugins

If you want to create a new plugin for libreevent, please follow our guide and guidelines in the official documentation [here](https://libreevent.janishutz.com/docs/contributing/plugins)

Each plugin should have a plugin.json file that uses the layout of the plugin.json file in this directory. As future libreevent might change what is required by the plugin.json file, please follow this repository to get news when this is about to happen. To retain backwards compatibility, we will for as long as possible not remove anything from the plugin.json files as possible, which means you can already update your plugin.json file before the next version of libreevent is released.
